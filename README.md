# ðŸŽ¬ Unity-AnimationSystem
A easy to use animation system for Unity projects that doesn't require an **Animator Controller**. Simply attach the **Animation State Manager** component to GameObject, and manage animation states directly from the Inspector. Assign **animation clips**, **audio clips**, or even **animation events** with ease. Once configured, seamlessly trigger animation states via code. Good solution for quick prototyping or managing simple straightforward animation states.
